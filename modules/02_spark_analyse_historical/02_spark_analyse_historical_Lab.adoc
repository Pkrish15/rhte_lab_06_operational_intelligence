== Overview

=== Lab Goals

* Apache Spark Deployment using Apache Zeppelin
* Uber Historical Data Analysis using SparkSQL
* Usage of Interactive NoteBooks like Apache Zeppelin


=== Technical Background

==== Apache Spark
. *Apache Spark*
+
Apache Spark is a fast, easy-to-use and general engine for big data processing that has built-in modules for streaming, SQL, Machine Learning (ML) and graph processing. Spark is a cluster-computing framework, which means that it competes more with MapReduce than with the entire Hadoop ecosystem. For example, Spark doesn't have its own distributed filesystem, but can use HDFS. Spark uses memory and can use disk for processing, whereas MapReduce is strictly disk-based.

. *Spark MLlib*
+
MLib is Spark's scalable machine learning library consisting of common learning algorithms and utilities, including classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, as well as underlying optimization primitives.

. *Apache Zeppelin*
+
Apache Zeppelin is a multi-purpose web-based notebook which brings data ingestion, data exploration, visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Hadoop and Spark.
Based on the concept of an interpreter that can be bound to any language or data processing backend, Zeppelin is a web based notebook server.
As one of its backends, Zeppelin implements Spark, and other implementations, such as Hive, Markdown, D3 etc., are also available.
Zeppelin has support for multiple interpreters like Scala, Python, Kotlin, HBase.
Zeppelin has a built in Scala and Python Intepretors.
These interpreters can be utilized to visualize raw historical data.

. *Spark Notebook*
+
The Spark Notebook is the open source notebook aimed at enterprise environments, providing Data Scientists and Data Engineers with an interactive web-based editor that can combine Scala code, SQL queries, Markup and JavaScript in a collaborative manner to explore, analyse and learn from massive data sets.

. *Spark SQL*
+
Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing. It enables unmodified Hadoop Hive queries to run up to 100x faster on existing deployments and data. It also provides powerful integration with the rest of the Spark ecosystem (e.g., integrating SQL query processing with machine learning).

. *Resilient Distributed Datasets*
+
Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) is a fundamental data structure of Spark. It is an immutable distributed collection of objects. Each dataset in RDD is divided into logical partitions, which may be computed on different nodes of the cluster. Spark Actions are RDD operations that produce non-RDD values. They materialize a value in a Spark program. In other words, a RDD operation returns a value of any type.

. *SparkContext*
+
SparkContext is the heart of a Spark application. Once a SparkContext is created you can use it to create RDDs, accumulators and broadcast variables, access Spark services and run jobs (until SparkContext is stopped).

==== Oshinko

==== What is Oshinko?

The Oshinko project covers several individual applications which all focus on the goal of deploying and managing Apache Spark clusters on Red Hat OpenShift and OpenShift Origin.

==== How Oshinko is Related to our Lab?

This Lab demonstrates the usage of Oshinko Cluster and the Spark Application (i.e Zeppelin Notebook Application) will be deployed in Oshinko Cluster.

==== Who will deploy the Oshinko Cluster?

The students are expected to deploy the Oshinko Cluster in the OpenShift Environment with their assigned userId. Detailed instructions are provided in this lab.

== Oshinko Cluster
=== Overview

Oshinko is the project focused on providing a Spark cluster on OpenShift Container Platform.
In this section of the lab, you will provision Oshinko.

The Oshinko project covers several individual applications which all focus on the goal of deploying and managing Apache Spark clusters on Red Hat OpenShift and OpenShift Origin.
With the Oshinko family of applications you can create, scale, and destroy Apache Spark clusters. These clusters can then be used by your applications within an OpenShift project by providing a simple connection URL to the cluster. There are multiple paths to achieving this: browser based graphical interface, command line tool, and a RESTful server.

To begin your exploration, we recommend starting with the oshinko-webui application.

The oshinko-webui is a self-contained deployment of the Oshinko technologies.
An OpenShift user can deploy the oshinko-webui container into their project and then access the server with a web browser.
Through the browser interface you will be able to manage Apache Spark clusters within your project.
Once installed, it consists of a Node.JS application that is contained within a Pod and provides a web browser based user interface for controlling the lifecycle of Spark clusters.


Another important part of Oshinko to highlight is the oshinko-s2i repository and associated images which implement the source-to-image workflow for Apache Spark based applications. These images enable you to create full applications that can be built, deployed and upgraded directly from a source repository.



=== Provision

-----


. Log into the Oshinko web UI
.. Point your browser to the output of the following command:
+
-----
$ echo -en "\n\nhttp://"$(oc get route/oshinko-web -o template --template {{.spec.host}} -n $OCP_USERNAME-uber-data)/webui"\n\n"
-----
+
image::images/oshinko_homepage.png[]

.. At this time, the Oshinko web UI is not secured. It is recommended to use Oshinko webui non-secured port.
+
Subsequently, you should be able to access the UI without authenticating.


== Zeppelin

=== Overview
A completely open web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. Apache Zeppelin is a new and incubating multi-purposed web-based notebook which brings data ingestion, data exploration, visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Hadoop and Spark.

Interactive browser-based notebooks enable data engineers, data analysts and data scientists to be more productive by developing, organizing, executing, and sharing data code and visualizing results without referring to the command line or needing the cluster details. Notebooks allow these users not only allow to execute but to interactively work with long workflows.  There are a number of notebooks available with Spark. iPython remains a mature choice and great example of a data science notebook.  The Hortonworks Gallery provides an Ambari stack definition to help our customers quickly set up iPython on their Hadoop clusters.

Apache Zeppelin is a new and upcoming web-based notebook which brings data exploration, visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Spark.   It support Python, but also a growing list of programming languages such as Scala, Hive, SparkSQL, shell and markdown.

=== Architecture

image::images/zeppelinArchitecture.jpg[za]

Frontend: This provides UI and shells to interact with humans and a display system to show data in tabular, graphical form, and export iframe.

Zeppelin Server: This provides web sockets and the REST API to interact with the UI and access service remotely. There are two types of API calls—a REST API for notebooks and an Interpreter API for interpreters. The Notebook REST API is to interact with notebooks—creating paragraph, submitting paragraph job in batch, adding cron jobs, and so on. The Interpreter REST API is to change the configuration properties and restart the interpreter.

Pluggable Interpreter System: This is to interact with different interpreters such as Spark, Shell, Markdown, AngularJS, Hive, Ignite, Flink, and others.

Interpreters: Each interpreter runs in a separate JVM to provide the functionality needed by the user.

-----

image::images/zeppelin.png[uberstream7]

== Zeppelin Interpreter

=== Overview
Finally, you can find the Zeppelin running by accessing the Route URL. Configuration changes has to be made in Zeppelin Interpreter for our use case.

Zeppelin Interpreter is a plug-in which enables Zeppelin users to use a specific language/data-processing-backend. For example, to use Scala code in Zeppelin, you need %spark interpreter.

When you click the +Create button in the interpreter page, the interpreter drop-down list box will show all the available interpreters on your server.


=== Port(s) and protocols

In local Zeppelin's default port is 8080. Since we use OpenShift to deploy, we expose these ports which is given in the properties files to ensure two-way communication between the Spark-Master-Node and Spark-Worker-Node. To make enable these port changes, we need to edit the configuration settings of Zeppelin UI.

Below Figure Explain's the configuration settings of Zeppelin UI.


image::images/ZeppelinNewSettings.png[]

-----
...
Please add these properties in the zeppelin Intepreter settings

spark.driver.bindAddress	                            0.0.0.0
spark.driver.host	                                   apache-zeppelin
spark.driver.blockManager.port	                     42100
spark.driver.port	                                   42000
...
-----
Ensure that you have apache-zeppelin having this kind of configuration as shown in the given below figure.

image::images/PortZeppelin.png[portzepp]

=== Deployment Topology Diagram

image::images/DeploymentTopology.png[zeppelinTopo]

=== ClusterQuota and Limit Range for Zeppelin Interpreter

==== Cluster Quota
A resource quota, defined by a ResourceQuota object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a project by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources and storage that may be consumed by resources in that project.

==== Limit Range
A limit range, defined by a LimitRange object, enumerates compute resource constraints in a project at the pod, container, image, image stream, and persistent volume claim level, and specifies the amount of resources that a pod, container, image, image stream, or persistent volume claim can consume.

All resource create and modification requests are evaluated against each LimitRange object in the project. If the resource violates any of the enumerated constraints, then the resource is rejected. If the resource does not set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, then the default value is applied to the resource.

By default, all OCP projects are assigned a limit range.  the limit range assigns default limits and requests for both CPU and RAM if the DCs themselves don't specify limits and requests.
The default CPU limit is set to 1/20th of a CPU.  So Spark was running on 1/20th of a CPU.

In general, all of us should always understand the details of LimitRanges assigned to our projects.
And its very likely that we should be adding/tweaking the limits and requests in our DC's.

==== CPU Limits

Each container in a pod can specify the amount of CPU it is limited to use on a node. CPU limits control the maximum amount of CPU that your container may use independent of contention on the node. If a container attempts to exceed the specified limit, the system will throttle the container. This allows the container to have a consistent level of service independent of the number of pods scheduled to the node.

==== Memory Requests
By default, a container is able to consume as much memory on the node as possible. In order to improve placement of pods in the cluster, specify the amount of memory required for a container to run. The scheduler will then take available node memory capacity into account prior to binding your pod to a node. A container is still able to consume as much memory on the node as possible even when specifying a request.

==== Memory Limits
If you specify a memory limit, you can constrain the amount of memory the container can use. For example, if you specify a limit of 200Mi, a container will be limited to using that amount of memory on the node. If the container exceeds the specified memory limit, it will be terminated and potentially restarted dependent upon the container restart policy.

=== Do we need to Know them
The above parameters are managed by the cluster Administrator and Infrastructure team, Hence it is not needed for the students to learn. But a basic concept of Knowing this will help.

*Students are expected to learn this much alone.*

=== Inject Uber historical data

Zeppelin Data (ie.uber.csv file) has to be localized to the deployment pod for faster retrievals and gives the spark jobs to have data locality benefit. It also, helps us for faster querying on the data on Memory and to perform data analytics operations over mulitple iterations.

.. Navigate to Storage-->Create Storage. Create a PVC of 50MB from the Create Storage screen.
+
image::images/uber-data.png[uber7]
.. Attach it to the Pod.
+

image::images/pvc.png[uber9]

.. Mount the Volume as shown below.
+
image::images/uber-data-pvc.png[uber8]

.. Copy the Local Data to the Pod Directory using Rsync Command (Screen shot given below)
+
----
oc rsync src directory pod directory:/data
for Example
oc rsync /home/prakrish/workspace/uberdata-analysis/src/main/resources/data/ apache-zeppelin-2-f89tz:/data
----
+
image::images/ocrsync.png[uber10]

=== Import Uber _NoteBook_

It is the Source code and Output file that every students expected to Run and visualize the results.

.. Once the data copied, Open the Zeppelin URL using the URL determined in the previous section:
+
-----
$ echo -en "\n\nhttp://"$(oc get route/apache-zeppelin -o template --template {{.spec.host}} -n $OCP_USERNAME-uber-data)/"\n\n"
-----

.. Import the JSON File given the GitHub URL in the Zeppelin Notebook
+
image::images/UberDataImport.png[uberstream8]

.. You can change the directory structure in zeppelin notebook pointing to the data directory in POD
+
image::images/pvc-data-zeppelin.png[data-placeholder]

=== Execute Uber _Paragraphs_

.. It is an Important phase in the Lab2, Students are expected to run these each paragraphs. Careful attention and Execution is need in this phase.
.. Execute the cell at very stages and you can visualize the data, upon each query, Output will be cleared in the Zeppelin Notebook and the Students are expected to generate the output.

.. Import the Required Packages. Scala Import Statements to use the Spark API and Dependent Libraries.
+
image::images/Import.png[import]

.. Define StructType - Since the Data uber.csv is a raw data, we need to define them in the form of Structural Schema. Hence we are using StructType Class from SparkAPI to convert them into Structural Schema.
.. Why we are doing this - SparkSQL deals with structural schema very easily as we can register with Temp tables in the Memory and can retrieve the data faster.
+
image::images/StructuredSchema.png[ss]

.. Load the Data into DataFrames.
.. A DataFrame is a distributed collection of data, which is organized into named columns. Conceptually, it is equivalent to relational tables with good optimization techniques.

+
image::images/LoadCSV.png[ls]

.. PrintStructuralSchema and Display the StructuralSchema.
.. In this step we are printing Structural Schema to view the output on how the data (uber.csv) is placed. Also, we are caching the data in the spark Memory for faster data retrieval operations.
+
image::images/dfShow.png[df]
.. Define Feature Array.
.. Why Feature Array is needed?
... Feature Array is the process of using domain knowledge to choose which data metrics to input as features into a machine learning algorithm. Feature Array plays a key role in K-means clustering; using meaningful features that capture the variability of the data is essential for the algorithm to find all of the naturally-occurring groups.
... Categorical data (i.e., category labels such as gender, country, browser type) needs to be encoded or separated in a way that can still work with the algorithm.
+
image::images/df2show.png[df2]

.. KMeans Object is clustering with KMeans ++ like initialization mode. This is an iterative algorithm that will take multiple passes over the data, So that any RDD (Resilient Distributed DataSet) can be cached by the user.

.. Create a KMeans Object, Set the parameters to to define the number of clusters and the maximum number of iterations to determine the clusters, and then we fit the model to the input data.

== Conclusions

You have learned the concepts of Spark Cluster, Actions, Transformations, Spark SQL and NoteBook Deployment.

== Questions

TO-DO :  questions to test student knowledge of the concepts / learning objectives of this lab

== Appendix

===  Overview
So far we learned about Spark uses Zeppelin Notebook and Performs the Data Analysis based on the Historical Data.

===  What did we learn?
This Lab helps the students to get to know the basics of interactive notebook usage in the current big data scenario.

Basic deployment of spark jobs on Oshinko cluster amd connectivity of zeppelin notebook to the Spark Oshinko Cluster.

SparkSQL - Excellent API for structured streaming and it is an advanced concept in Apache Spark. Since, it uses catalyst optimizer, it provides an excellent performance benefits and it is the most prefered query language for the datascientists all over the world.

=== Background

According to Gartner, by 2020, a quarter of a billion connected cars will form a major element of the Internet of Things. Connected vehicles are projected to generate 25GB of data per hour, which can be analyzed to provide real-time monitoring and apps, and will lead to new concepts of mobility and vehicle usage. One of the 10 major areas in which big data is currently being used to excellent advantage is in improving cities. For example, the analysis of GPS car data can allow cities to optimize traffic flows based on real-time traffic information.

Uber is using big data to perfect its processes, from calculating Uber’s pricing, to finding the optimal positioning of cars to maximize profits. In this series of blog posts, we are going to use public Uber trip data to discuss building a real-time example for analysis and monitoring of car GPS data. There are typically two phases in machine learning with real-time data:

Data Discovery: The first phase involves analysis on historical data to build the machine learning model.

Analytics Using the Model: The second phase uses the model in production on live events. (Note that Spark does provide some streaming machine learning algorithms, but you still often need to do an analysis of historical data.)building the model.

In this first post, I’ll help you get started using Apache Spark’s machine learning K-means algorithm to cluster Uber data based on location.

=== Where do we get these DataSets?

===  What algorithm is suitable for Data Analytics?

Clustering uses unsupervised algorithms, which do not have the outputs (labeled data) in advance. K-means is one of the most commonly used clustering algorithms that clusters the data points into a predefined number of clusters (k). Clustering using the K-means algorithm begins by initializing all the coordinates to k number of centroids. With every pass of the algorithm, each point is assigned to its nearest centroid based on some distance metric, which is usually Euclidean distance. The centroids are then updated to be the “centers” of all the points assigned to it in that pass. This repeats until there is a minimum change in the centers.

===  What is in the data set?

The Data Set Schema
Date/Time: The date and time of the Uber pickup
Lat: The latitude of the Uber pickup
Lon: The longitude of the Uber pickup
Base: The TLC base company affiliated with the Uber pickup
​​The Data Records are in CSV format. An example line is shown below:
