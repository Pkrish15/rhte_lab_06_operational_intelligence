Includes the OpenTracing specification as well as the OpenTracing client libraries for many languages.


 
== Lab Asset Overview

=== Environment Variables

Before getting started, you'll want to open a terminal window and set the following environment variables that will be used throughout the duration of this lab.


-----
######  Instructor will provide the values to these environment variables #######

$ export REGION=<provided by your instructor>
$ export GUID=<provided by your instructor>
$ export OCP_PASSWD=<provided by your instructor>

#  Using above variables, copy & paste the following in same terminal #

$ export OCP_USERNAME=user$GUID
$ export OCP_PROJECT=uber-data-analysis
-----

=== Oshinko Cluster access

Basics of Apache Spark 2.3.1 (Spark-Shell, Actions and Transformations, Jobs).

Your lab environment also includes access to a Oshinko Cluster installation.

=== OpenShift access

You lab environment is built on Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform.

Access to your OCP resources can be gained via both the `oc` utility as well as the OCP web console.

. Log into OpenShift
+
-----
$ oc login https://master.$REGION.openshift.opentlc.com -u $OCP_USERNAME -p $ r3dh4t1!
-----

. Ensure that your `oc` client is the same minor release version as the server:
+
-----
$ oc version

oc v3.9.30
kubernetes v1.9.1+a0ce1bc657
features: Basic-Auth GSSAPI Kerberos SPNEGO

Server https://master.a4ec.openshift.opentlc.com:443
openshift v3.9.31
kubernetes v1.9.1+a0ce1bc657
-----

.. In the above example, notice that version of the `oc` client is of the same minor release (v3.9.30) of the OpenShift server (v3.9.31)
.. There a known subtle problems with using a version of the `oc` client that is different from your target OpenShift server.

. View existing projects:
+
-----
$ oc get projects

... 

user3-uber-data-analysis                                     Active
-----

. Switch to your  OpenShift project
+
-----
$ oc project $OCP_PROJECT
-----

. Log into OpenShift Web Console
.. Many OpenShift related tasks found in this lab can be completed in the Web Console (as an alternative to using the `oc` utility`.
.. To access, point to your browser to the output of the following:
+
-----
$ echo -en "\n\nhttps://master.$REGION.openshift.opentlc.com\n\n"
-----

.. Authenticate using the values of $OCP_USERNAME and $OCP_PASSWD

=== Deployment vs DeploymentConfig 

Your lab assets consist of a mix of OpenShift Deployment and DeploymentConfig resources.

The Deployment construct is a more recent Kubernetes equivalent of what has always been in OpenShift: DeploymentConfig.

. Review the Kafka Connect deployment

In the resources/kafka-connect/kafka-connect.yaml, under the spec object, review the configuration.

[source,text]
----
  config:
    key.converter: org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    value.converter: org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    key.converter.schemas.enable: false
    value.converter.schemas.enable: false
----

. Open a terminal in the Kakfa connect pod and verify that the input file has been copied to the /opt/kafka directory.

. A topic (file-publish) that Kafka Connect uses to publish to the Kafka broker has been created for you

. Create the configuration for the file source
+
[source,json]
----
% cat <<EOF >> /tmp/source-plugin.json
{
  "name": "source-test",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "FileStreamSource",
    "tasks.max": "3",
    "topic": "file-topic",
    "file": "/tmp/uber.csv"
  }
}
EOF
----

. Create a connector that will read the TXT file and push its cotnent into Kafka
+
[source,text]
----
% curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @/tmp/source-plugin.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
----

. Verify the contents are being published to the message consumer configured.
