== Overview

=== Background

Apache Spark is a fast, easy-to-use and general engine for big data processing that has built-in modules for streaming, SQL, Machine Learning (ML) and graph processing. Spark is a cluster-computing framework, which means that it competes more with MapReduce than with the entire Hadoop ecosystem. For example, Spark doesn't have its own distributed filesystem, but can use HDFS. Spark uses memory and can use disk for processing, whereas MapReduce is strictly disk-based.

MLlib is Spark's scalable machine learning library consisting of common learning algorithms and utilities, including classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, as well as underlying optimization primitives.

Apache Zeppelin is a multi-purpose web-based notebook which brings data ingestion, data exploration, visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Hadoop and Spark. Based on the concept of an interpreter that can be bound to any language or data processing backend, Zeppelin is a web based notebook server. As one of its backends, Zeppelin implements Spark, and other implementations, such as Hive, Markdown, D3 etc., are also available. Zeppelin has support for multiple interpreters like Scala, Python, Kotlin, HBase.

The Spark Notebook is the open source notebook aimed at enterprise environments, providing Data Scientists and Data Engineers with an interactive web-based editor that can combine Scala code, SQL queries, Markup and JavaScript in a collaborative manner to explore, analyse and learn from massive data sets.

Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing. It enables unmodified Hadoop Hive queries to run up to 100x faster on existing deployments and data. It also provides powerful integration with the rest of the Spark ecosystem (e.g., integrating SQL query processing with machine learning).

Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) is a fundamental data structure of Spark. It is an immutable distributed collection of objects. Each dataset in RDD is divided into logical partitions, which may be computed on different nodes of the cluster. Spark Actions are RDD operations that produce non-RDD values. They materialize a value in a Spark program. In other words, a RDD operation returns a value of any type.

SparkContext is the heart of a Spark application. Once a SparkContext is created you can use it to create RDDs, accumulators and broadcast variables, access Spark services and run jobs (until SparkContext is stopped).

=== Reference
 
=== Github project for the analysis and the use of notebooks

The below link is the GitHub URL for this code. Main.scala is the code applied to the Zeppelin Notebook to analyse the data.
Since we have used SparkSQL, we can keep on querying the data with different results to get different statistics. We can alter the queries and take different views of the data.

https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/operational_intelligence/tree/master/uber-data-analysis


Zeppelin has a built in Scala and Python Intepretor which can visualize the data.

== Conclusions

You have learned the concepts of Spark Cluster, Actions, Transformations, Spark SQL and NoteBook Deployment.

== Questions

TO-DO :  questions to test student knowledge of the concepts / learning objectives of this lab

== Appendix

===  Overview 
So far we learned about Spark uses Zeppelin Notebook and Performs the Data Analysis based on the Historical Data.

===  What did we learn?
This Lab helps the students to get to know the basics of interactive notebook usage in the current big data scenario.

Basic deployment of spark jobs on Oshinko cluster amd connectivity of zeppelin notebook to the Spark Oshinko Cluster.

SparkSQL - Excellent API for structured streaming and it is an advanced concept in Apache Spark. Since, it uses catalyst optimizer, it provides an excellent performance benefits and it is the most prefered query language for the datascientists all over the world.

=== Background

According to Gartner, by 2020, a quarter of a billion connected cars will form a major element of the Internet of Things. Connected vehicles are projected to generate 25GB of data per hour, which can be analyzed to provide real-time monitoring and apps, and will lead to new concepts of mobility and vehicle usage. One of the 10 major areas in which big data is currently being used to excellent advantage is in improving cities. For example, the analysis of GPS car data can allow cities to optimize traffic flows based on real-time traffic information.

Uber is using big data to perfect its processes, from calculating Uber’s pricing, to finding the optimal positioning of cars to maximize profits. In this series of blog posts, we are going to use public Uber trip data to discuss building a real-time example for analysis and monitoring of car GPS data. There are typically two phases in machine learning with real-time data:

Data Discovery: The first phase involves analysis on historical data to build the machine learning model.

Analytics Using the Model: The second phase uses the model in production on live events. (Note that Spark does provide some streaming machine learning algorithms, but you still often need to do an analysis of historical data.)building the model.

In this first post, I’ll help you get started using Apache Spark’s machine learning K-means algorithm to cluster Uber data based on location.

=== Where do we get these DataSets?

http://data.beta.nyc/dataset/uber-trip-data-foiled-apr-sep-2014 

===  What algorithm is suitable for Data Analytics?

Clustering uses unsupervised algorithms, which do not have the outputs (labeled data) in advance. K-means is one of the most commonly used clustering algorithms that clusters the data points into a predefined number of clusters (k). Clustering using the K-means algorithm begins by initializing all the coordinates to k number of centroids. With every pass of the algorithm, each point is assigned to its nearest centroid based on some distance metric, which is usually Euclidean distance. The centroids are then updated to be the “centers” of all the points assigned to it in that pass. This repeats until there is a minimum change in the centers.

===  What is in the data set?

The Data Set Schema
Date/Time: The date and time of the Uber pickup
Lat: The latitude of the Uber pickup
Lon: The longitude of the Uber pickup
Base: The TLC base company affiliated with the Uber pickup
​​The Data Records are in CSV format. An example line is shown below:

2014-08-01 00:00:00,40.729,-73.9422,B02598 

===  How do we do it?

Load the data into a Spark Data Frame

image::https://github.com/Pkrish15/uber-datanalysis/blob/master/2.png[uberstream2]

Define Features Array
In order for the features to be used by a machine learning algorithm, the features are transformed and put into Feature Vectors, which are vectors of numbers representing the value for each feature. Below, a VectorAssembler is used to transform and return a new DataFrame with all of the feature columns in a vector column. <br>

image::https://github.com/Pkrish15/uber-datanalysis/blob/master/3.png[uberstream3]

Create a KMeans Object, set the parameters to define the number of clusters and the maximum number of iterations to determine the clusters and then we fit our model to the input data.

image::https://github.com/Pkrish15/uber-datanalysis/blob/master/4.png[uberstream4]

Output, Cluster Centers are displayed on the Google Map

Further Analysis of cluster

image::https://github.com/Pkrish15/uber-datanalysis/blob/master/6.png[uberstream6]

===  What are the Analysis Questions? 

**** Which hour of the day and which cluster had highest number of pickups?

**** How many pickups occured in each cluster?

== Common Issues and How to trouble Shoot?

You might have notice Zeppelin Always gets Broken Pipe Exception and Thrift Error.This is because at the backend the zeppelin executes the Spark Job which is Built-in (i.e) embedded with Zeppelin. In a real time scenario, this will never happen as we will have adequate amount of memory and execellent cluster configuration. Basic Architecture Diagram of Zeppelin will explain on how it works.

=== TroubleShooting the Thrift Exception and Broken Pipe Exception.

==== Still Running on the Problem?

If you are still facing exception, Currently the data size 35MB and Quering 3LAKH rows, Reduce the size to 2-3MB and keep the Row count to 1500-2000 Rows and execute the cell by cell analysis.  In a real time scenario, you won't face these kind of exceptions.

To Reduce the size of the records to 1500-2000 rows, you have to repeat the steps of oc rsync command and upload the reduced data in the pod.
